># The magical world of the US Senate
>## Scope:
>Sometimes our politicians seem more like cartoon characters than the selfless cogs
>of democracy that we hope them to be. This very patriotic app would utilize an api 
>released by the sunlight foundation (https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) and do the following:

*   Find users' senator using zipcode.

*   A method then evaluates based on a sampling of legislative action what disney character they are 
    most like. For example, a vote for S. 1238 (A bill that would set student loan
    interest rates to lower levels) would set that person on track to be Robin Hood. This process would be very scientific.  

*   Show user a picture of their disney senator, a few of their votes, and their contact information.

>## User Stories in order of implementation:

* As a user, I want to sign in so I can have my selected senator(s) saved.

* As a user, I want to input my zipcode and see what US senator represents me because I may not know.

* As a user, I want to click on my senator and see what Disney character they are most like because I read too much Buzzfeed. 

* As a user, I want to see some legislative actions that my senator made so I can understand why they are like that Disney character. 

* As a user, I want to see some links to my senator's social media so I can contact them.

* As a user, I want to search again so I can learn about other representatives. 

>## Resources:

* https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/ is an API. 

* https://github.com/codeforamerica/congress is a Gem which acts as an API wrapper.

>## Object Models and Wireframs:

* Avaiable upon request, camera isn't working will upload ASAP
